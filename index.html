        <h2> a good story</h2>
        <p>When I was very young, I decided to follow Jesus while my mom made cookies and I ate cookie dough. God has blessed me with an incredible family; my wife and I have three amazing kids. Outdoor activities, music, sports, and learning are some of my favourite things to do.

        <p>I advocate for adventure and believe my walk with Jesus is the most incredible adventure I have ever embarked on. This adventure began when I chose Jesus early in my adulthood; since then, I have never looked back. I enjoy camping, coffee, and creativity.
